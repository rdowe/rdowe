Hi, my name is Becca Dowe. I graduated magna cum laude from Carthage College with a major in physics, and minors in German and computer science.

My GitHub is an extension of my portfolio website over at https://dowerebecca.weebly.com so there's an easier way to access some of the code I've written during my time at Carthage.
