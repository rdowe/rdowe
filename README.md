Hi, my name is Becca Dowe and I'm a physics major with the astrophysics concentration at Carthage College, and I have minors in German and computer science.
In the future, I plan on going to grad school to do research in computational astrophysics.

My GitHub is an extension of my portfolio website over at https://rebeccadowe.weebly.com so there's an easier way to access some of the code I've written during my time at Carthage.
